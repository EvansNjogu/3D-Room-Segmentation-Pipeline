A comprehensive pipeline for 3D room segmentation using point cloud data, integrating PointNet++, plane fitting and clustering techniques. This project covers the full process from data acquisition and preprocessing to segmentation and visualization, applied to datasets like **[Stanford 2D-3D Indoor Spaces (S3DIS)](http://buildingparser.stanford.edu/dataset.html)** and **[KITTI](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/)**.

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to build an accurate and efficient segmentation pipeline capable of processing large 3D indoor environments. By leveraging **PointNet++** for semantic segmentation and integrating traditional point cloud methods, the pipeline achieves high performance in segmenting and visualizing complex 3D spaces.

### Key Features:
- Data Acquisition & Preprocessing
   - Supports Stanford 2D-3D Indoor Scenes (S3DIS) and KITTI datasets.  
   - Downsampling, noise filtering and outlier removal using Open3D.  
   - Voxel downsampling and statistical outlier removal.  

- 3D Segmentation & Clustering 
   - Plane segmentation (RANSAC) to detect ground and walls.  
   - Region growing and DBSCAN for clustering and object detection.  
   - Semantic segmentation using PointNet++.  

- Visualization
   - Color-coded segmentation outputs.  
   - Real-time 3D point cloud visualization with Open3D.  
   - Confusion matrices and classification reports to evaluate performance.
